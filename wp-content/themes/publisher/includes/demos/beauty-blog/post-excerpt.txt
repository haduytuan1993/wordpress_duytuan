I’m actually loving this moisturizer at the moment, and didn’t know I could really love a moisturizer as much. Been using this one by Dior – mostly at night, and occasionally during the day. Concentrated in Iris extract, it has antioxidants in it to delay ageing – and hydrates the skin and gives it a supple finish. I’ve been avoiding foundations a lot more now, and going for things that make my skin, look like ‘skin’. 

I don’t even know how to describe this, but it’s a magic potion in a bottle. I can’t really explain this product, except for it being very different to anything else on the market. I can use this by itself (which I mostly do) and on night outs, I use this instead of a primer. It has blurring effects, while still adding a glow – so you get that clear luminous finish.
