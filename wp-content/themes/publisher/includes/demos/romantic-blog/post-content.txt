We’re always on the lookout for movers, shakers, and rule-breakers in the wedding world, so it’s no surprise that we were immediately obsessed upon discovering <a href="#">Something Borrowed Blooms</a>. The first Rent and Return Floral Boutique of its kind, Something Borrowed Blooms is here to help you balance wanting beautiful flowers on your wedding day with not breaking the bank in the process. Something Borrowed Blooms provides an alternative to traditional wedding flowers (and traditional wedding flower prices) with gorgeous silk flowers. At a fraction of the cost you’d spend on fresh blooms for your day, you can receive the highest quality silk floral arrangements with just a few clicks.

If you’re familiar with Rent The Runway, then you already understand why Something Borrowed Blooms is so great! When it comes to a one-time-use good, whether that be a floor-length sequin gown or a bridal bouquet, why break the bank to afford it when you can rent it and return it? Something Borrowed Blooms was created after co-founder Lauren’s firsthand disappointment with the traditional wedding floral experience. Feeling like she overpaid for what was underdelivered, she knew there had to be a better way.

Enter the Rent and Return model. You pick your flowers, Something Borrowed Blooms ships them your way, you enjoy a stress-free wedding with exactly the flowers you fell in love with from their site, then box them up and send them back via pre-paid mail! Don’t you wish every aspect of wedding planning could be this easy?

It’s Budget Friendly. Traditionally, wedding flowers are one of the most expensive aspects of a wedding. From bouquets to centerpieces, a lot of blooms go into making a wedding floral design, and your favorite flowers often cost a pretty penny. If fresh flowers aren’t a major priority, consider allocating more of your wedding budget to what’s really important to you: photography and videography, food, or even your honeymoon! Receiving your wedding flowers through Something Borrowed Blooms costs a fraction of what you can expect to spend with a traditional florist, so if you’re on a tight budget, renting is a cost-effective alternative.
